# 🚗 Urban Routes – Analysis of Requirements and Test Cases Design

---

### 📌 Project Overview

This project consists of the analysis, decomposition, and test design for the Car Sharing feature of the Urban Routes application.

The main objective was to transform functional requirements into structured QA documentation, applying professional test design techniques such as:

- Equivalence Class Partitioning  
- Boundary Value Analysis  
- Flow Diagram Modeling  
- Requirement Decomposition  
- Grey Area Identification  

---

### 🎯 Objectives

- Decompose and visualize requirements  
- Identify test objects  
- Detect and document requirement ambiguities (“grey areas”)  
- Design structured test cases  
- Validate calculation logic for trip duration and pricing  

---

### 🧠 Requirement Analysis & Visualization

#### 1️⃣ Mind Map – “Add Driver’s License”

##### A visual breakdown of:

- Interface requirements  
- Functional behavior  
- Valid and invalid input scenarios  
- Identified grey areas in the requirements  

📌 Tool used: draw.io  
📄 Delivered as PDF  

---

#### 2️⃣ Equivalence Classes & Boundary Values

##### Defined for:

- “First Name”  
- “Last Name”  

##### Included:

- Positive scenarios  
- Negative scenarios  
- Boundary values  
- Selected representative test values  

📌 Technique applied:

- Equivalence Partitioning  
- Boundary Value Analysis  

📊 Tool used: Excel (Google Sheets template)

#### 3️⃣ Flow Diagram – Vehicle Speed Selection Logic

Designed a flow diagram to represent the logic for selecting average vehicle speed based on departure time.

##### The diagram models:

- Time intervals  
- Decision points  
- Logical branching  
- Output speed selection  

📌 Tool used: draw.io  
📄 Delivered as PDF  

---

#### 4️⃣ Test Design – Trip Duration & Price Calculation

Designed test cases to validate:

- Trip duration calculation  
- Price calculation  

##### Dependency on:

- Distance  
- Departure time  
- Selected speed logic  

##### Special validation included:

- Distance = 0 (edge case)  
- Multiple time intervals  
- Logical dependency validation  

📌 Test cases written in structured format in Excel
